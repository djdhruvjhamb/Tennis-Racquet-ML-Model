2. School- Avenues: The World School, New York
3. Class: Advanced Computer Science
4. Existing Project: This is an ML model I created to analyze the tennis racquet at any given point during a tennis serve. Currently, it is at an OKS of 85% accuracy, and I hope to improve it to near 99.9% with a more extensive data set.
